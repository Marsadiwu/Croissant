    <h1>CROISSANT</h1>
    <div class="description">
      These flaky, golden-colored, crescent-shaped pastries are best made with
      pure butter and a slightly sweet yeast dough. If made properly, the
      yellow-white interior should be just the slightest bit elastic when pulled
      from the center, ready to be covered with a pad of butter or some fresh
      jam.
      <br />
      Experts agree that the croissant was heavily influenced by Austrian
      kipfels. This pastry originated in 1683 as a celebration of the Austrian
      victory over the Ottoman Empire, its shape supposedly mimicking the
      crescent moon found on the Turkish flag.
      <br />
      However, the croissant became French the moment people began to make it
      with puff pastry, a French innovation. Today, French croissants come
      filled with chocolate, jam, raisins, or even cream cheese. Sold fresh at
      numerous French boulangeries, they are mainly consumed as a breakfast
      item.
